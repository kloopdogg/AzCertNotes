## Defense in depth
The objective of defense-in-depth is to protect information and prevent it from being stolen by those who aren't authorized to access it. A defense-in-depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack that aims at acquiring unauthorized access to data.
- A layered approach to securing computer systems
- Provides multiple levels of protection
- Attacks against one layer are isolated from subsequent layers

Here's a brief overview of the role of each layer:

- The physical security layer is the first line of defense - to protect computing hardware in the datacenter.
- The identity and access layer controls access to - infrastructure and change control.
- The perimeter layer uses distributed denial of service - (DDoS) protection to filter large-scale attacks before - they can cause a denial of service for users.
- The network layer limits communication between resources - through segmentation and access controls.
- The compute layer secures access to virtual machines.
- The application layer helps ensure that applications are - secure and free of security vulnerabilities.
- The data layer controls access to business and customer data that you need to protect.
