# Azure OpenAI Service

Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI to deliver on three main goals:

- To utilize Azure's infrastructure, including security, compliance, and regional availability, to help users build enterprise-grade applications.
- To deploy OpenAI AI model capabilities across Microsoft products, including and beyond Azure AI products.
- To use Azure to power all of OpenAI's workloads.

## Azure OpenAI Service
Azure OpenAI Service is a result of the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI. The service combines Azure's enterprise-grade capabilities with OpenAI's generative AI model capabilities.

Azure OpenAI consists of four components:

- Pre-trained generative AI models
- Customization capabilities; the ability to fine-tune AI models with your own data
- Built-in tools to detect and mitigate harmful use cases so users can implement AI responsibly
- Enterprise-grade security with role-based access control (RBAC) and private networks

## Responsible AI
Usage of Azure OpenAI should follow the six [Microsoft AI principles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-responsible-ai):

- **Fairness**: AI systems shouldn't make decisions that discriminate against or support bias of a group or individual.
- **Reliability and Safety**: AI systems should respond safely to new situations and potential manipulation.
- **Privacy and Security**: AI systems should be secure and respect data privacy.
- **Inclusiveness**: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people.
- **Accountability**: People must be accountable for how AI systems operate.
- **Transparency**: AI systems should have explanations so users can understand how they're built and used.
