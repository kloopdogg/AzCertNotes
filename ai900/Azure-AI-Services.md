# Azure AI Services
Azure AI services are a portfolio of AI capabilities for workloads in language, vision, intelligent search, content generation, etc.

Services are based on three principles that dramatically improve speed-to-market:
- Prebuilt and ready to use
- Accessed through APIs
- Available on Azure

 Two types of AI service resources:
- **Multi-service resource**
    - A resource that provides access to multiple Azure AI services with a single key and endpoint.
    - Use the resource Azure AI services when you need several AI services or are exploring AI capabilities.
    - All your AI services are billed together.
- **Single-service resources**
    - A resource created in the Azure portal that provides access to a single Azure AI service, such as Speech, Vision, Language, etc.
    - Each service has a unique key and endpoint. 
    - Resources might be used when you only require one AI service or want to see cost information separately.

**Service Studio Interfaces** \
Studio interfaces provide a friendly UI to explore Azure AI services. There are different studios for different Azure AI services, such as Vision Studio, Language Studio, Speech Studio, and the Content Safety Studio.

> After creating a new AI Service, you have to associate it with the Studio.
